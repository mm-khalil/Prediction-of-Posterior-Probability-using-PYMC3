# Prediction-of-Posterior-Probability-using-PYMC3

We have some past data and from that available data we need to find Posterior probability using pymc3 library.

Question is here:
• Mr. Kim repeatedly tried to pass a written exam.
• This exam has 50 four-choice questions. Each correct answer is two points.
• In order to pass, one requires a score of at least 60 points out of 100, so needs to answer at 
least 30 questions correctly to pass.
• He failed to pass the test on 949 consecutively.
• We know that on his final and 950th attempt, he answered 30 questions correctly.
• In his 949 unsuccessful attempts, the number of correct answers had ranged from 15 to 25.
• With this knowledge, what can we say about the latent probability that Mr. Kim can answer 
any one question correctly?
• Note that we assume each question is equally difficult, and that Mr. Kim does not learn 
from his earlier attempts.
